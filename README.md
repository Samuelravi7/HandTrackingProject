# HandTrackingProject
This is my first ever repository on Github.

To start with this project, the following modules need to be downloaded beforehand in your python interpreter
- OpenCV
- mediapipe

This project basically replaces the function of keyboard and mouse through a combination of hand gestures to initiate a command. A mouse click for example.
There are 5 files needed to run this code namely HandTrackingModule.py, main.py, app.py
