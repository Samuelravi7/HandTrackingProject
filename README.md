# HandTrackingProject
This is my first ever repository on Github.

To start with this project, the following modules need to be downloaded beforehand in your python interpreter
- OpenCV
- mediapipe

This project basically replaces the function of keyboard and mouse through a combination of hand gestures to initiate a command. A mouse click for example.
There are only 2 files neccesary for the hand tracking code to run. Main.py and HandTrackingModule.py. The rest is just an extra step to run it through a website. 

Happy coding!!
